# About

A Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a framework that consists of several phases that guide the process of developing software from idea to deployment and maintenance. 

# Waterfall Model

This model is a sequential/linear SDLC approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins. 

Phases: Requirement Analysis, System Design, Implementation, Integration and Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. 

# V-Model (Validation and Verification Model)

This model is an extension of the Waterfall model that emphasizes the parallel relationship between development phases and corresponding testing phases. For every development phase (e.g., requirements specification), there is a corresponding testing phase (e.g., user acceptance testing). 

It is best suited for projects with clear, fixed requirements and where verification and validation are critical.

# Iterative Model

This model develops a system through repeated cycles (iterations) and each iteration is an opportunity to improve the previous one.

# Spiral Model

This model combines the `Iterative model` with the systematic aspects of the `Waterfall model`.

# Agile Model

This model breaks the project into small, manageable chunks called sprints or iterations, each delivering a functional product increment. 

It is well-suited for dynamic projects where requirements are expected to evolve. 

Agile Frameworks include: Scrum, Kanban, Lean, Extreme Programming, and Crystal.

# Rapid Application Development (RAD) Model

This model prioritizes rapid prototyping iterating on feedback.

# Big Bang Model

This model is an ad-hoc and high-risk approach where development is done with little planning. The entire software is built and tested as a whole. 

It is only suited for small projects with simple requirements or for experiment.

# Incremental Model

This model divides the project into smaller, manageable modules and develops each one independently.

# DevOps Model

This model integrates development (Dev) and operations (Ops) to automate processes and shorten the software delivery lifecycle. It emphasizes continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery (CD), and automation to ensure rapid deployment. 

It is ideal for projects requiring frequent updates and quick release cycles.
