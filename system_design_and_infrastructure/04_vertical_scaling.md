# About

In vertical scaling, scaling up is the practice of increasing the hardware capacity (CPU, RAM, solid-state device) of an instance. There is an upper bound (a limit of expansion) of how much it can scale. This results in a single point of failure since everything is running on a single machine. If the machine goes down everything goes down. There is a point where upgrading will be prohibitively expensive. Downtime costs companies a lot of money.
