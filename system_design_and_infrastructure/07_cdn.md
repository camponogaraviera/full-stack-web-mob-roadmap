# About

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of servers spread across the globe with the primary purpose of reducing the load on origin servers and data stores. It is also used to minimize client latency (time to render the page) by delivering static files from geographically closer edge servers, thus reducing the need for requests to traverse long distances to the origin server. It can get very expensive as the system scales.

Use case: if a user from Taiwan wants to watch a Korean movie that was originally stored on a server in Korea, the system will fetch a copy of this movie from a geographically closer available server (e.g., a server in Taiwan).
